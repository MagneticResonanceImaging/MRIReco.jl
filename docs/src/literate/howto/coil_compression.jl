# # [Compress Multi-Coil Data](@id coil-compression)
#
# Modern receive arrays have 16 to 64 coils. The memory and the reconstruction time grow with the number of coils,
# for iterative reconstructions roughly linearly. But the coils are not independent: neighboring coils see the object
# with similar sensitivities, so their signals are strongly correlated. *Coil compression* exploits this. It replaces
# the $N_c$ physical coils by $N_v < N_c$ *virtual coils*, which are linear combinations of the physical ones and
# carry most of the signal.
#
# This guide explains how coil compression works and shows how to
# - choose the number of virtual coils,
# - compress the data with the two methods of MRICoilSensitivities, [`softwareCoilCompression`](@ref) and
#   [`geometricCoilCompression`](@ref),
# - use the compressed data in a reconstruction with coil sensitivities.
#
# We use the fully sampled knee data from [Direct Reconstruction](@ref direct-reconstruction), a 2D Cartesian slice
# acquired with 8 coils. Eight coils is few, so the gain in reconstruction time is small here, but the principle is
# the same for larger arrays.

# ## Loading the Data
#
# As in the other tutorials, the reference is the direct reconstruction with the coil images combined by the root sum
# of squares:

datadir = joinpath(pkgdir(MRIReco), "docs", "src", "examples", "data")
filename = joinpath(datadir, "knee_3dFSE_slice170.h5")
acqData = AcquisitionData(ISMRMRDFile(filename))

params = Dict{Symbol, Any}()
params[:reco] = "direct"
params[:reconSize] = (320, 320)
rootSumOfSquares(images) = sqrt.(sum(abs2, images, dims = 5))[:, :, 1, 1, 1, 1]
coilImages = reconstruction(acqData, params)
referenceImage = rootSumOfSquares(coilImages)
deviation(image) = round(nrmsd(referenceImage, image), sigdigits = 2)
nothing #hide

# The k-space data of a contrast, slice and repetition is stored as a matrix with one column per coil:

kdata = acqData.kdata[1, 1, 1]
size(kdata)

# ## How Coil Compression Works
#
# Let $\mathbf{K}$ be this $N_s \times N_c$ matrix, with $N_s$ samples and $N_c$ coils. A virtual coil is a linear
# combination of the columns of $\mathbf{K}$. With a *compression matrix* $\mathbf{A}$ of size $N_c \times N_v$,
# the data of the $N_v$ virtual coils is
# ```math
# \mathbf{K}_v = \mathbf{K}\mathbf{A}.
# ```
# The best choice of $\mathbf{A}$, in the sense that $\mathbf{K}_v$ keeps as much of the energy of $\mathbf{K}$ as
# possible, follows from the singular value decomposition $\mathbf{K} = \mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^H$:
# $\mathbf{A}$ consists of the first $N_v$ columns of $\mathbf{V}$, the right singular vectors belonging to the
# largest singular values. The columns of $\mathbf{A}$ are orthonormal, so the compression is a rotation of the coils
# followed by discarding the weakest virtual coils.
#
# The singular values $\sigma_i$ tell how much signal each virtual coil carries. Here, the first virtual coil already
# contains about 70 % of the energy $\sum_i \sigma_i^2$:

σ = svdvals(kdata)
energy = cumsum(σ .^ 2) ./ sum(σ .^ 2)

fig = Figure(size = (700, 300))
ax1 = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel = "Virtual coil", xticks = 1:8, ylabel = "σᵢ / σ₁", title = "Singular values")
scatterlines!(ax1, σ ./ σ[1])
ax2 = Axis(fig[1, 2], xlabel = "Number of virtual coils", xticks = 1:8, ylabel = "Fraction",
           title = "Cumulative energy")
scatterlines!(ax2, energy)
ylims!(ax2, 0, 1.02)
fig

# A common rule of thumb is to keep enough virtual coils to retain 95 to 99 % of the energy. For this data set,
# that means 4 to 6 of the 8 coils.
#
# !!! note
#     The compression matrix only depends on the correlation between the coils, not on the image. It can therefore be
#     computed from a subset of the data, for example the first contrast or repetition, or the fully sampled
#     calibration region, and applied to the rest. The keywords `sContr` and `sRep` select the contrast and repetition
#     used for this calibration.

# ## Software Coil Compression
#
# [`softwareCoilCompression`](@ref) computes a single compression matrix for all the data, as described above
# (Huang et al., 2008). Applied to an `AcquisitionData`, it returns the compressed data and the compression matrices,
# one per slice:

numVC = 4
acqDataSCC, ccMatSCC = softwareCoilCompression(acqData, numVC)
size(acqDataSCC.kdata[1, 1, 1]), size(ccMatSCC[1])

# The images of the virtual coils show how the signal is concentrated: the first virtual coil looks like a coil
# combined image, the following ones carry less and less signal.

coilImagesSCC = reconstruction(acqDataSCC, params)
showimages([abs.(coilImagesSCC[:, :, 1, 1, c, 1]) for c in 1:numVC],
           ["Virtual coil $c" for c in 1:numVC])

# The root sum of squares of the virtual coil images is close to the reference. Because the compression matrix has
# orthonormal columns, keeping all 8 virtual coils would reproduce the reference exactly:

imageSCC = rootSumOfSquares(coilImagesSCC)
showimages([referenceImage, imageSCC, 10 .* abs.(referenceImage .- imageSCC)],
           ["8 coils", "$numVC virtual coils (SCC), NRMSD $(deviation(imageSCC))",
            "Difference × 10"])

# ## Geometric Coil Compression
#
# The coil sensitivities vary in space, so the best combination of the coils is not the same everywhere.
# For Cartesian data, the readout direction is always fully sampled. [`geometricCoilCompression`](@ref) (Zhang et al.,
# 2013) uses this: it applies the inverse Fourier transform along the readout direction, computes one compression
# matrix for each position $x$ along this direction, and transforms the compressed data back to k-space.
#
# The SVD determines each matrix only up to a rotation of the virtual coils. Neighboring positions would then get
# virtual coils that do not match, which creates artifacts in the reconstructed images. The matrices are therefore
# *aligned*: starting from the center, each matrix is rotated to be as close as possible to its neighbor, so that the
# virtual coils vary smoothly along $x$.
#
# The keyword `dim` selects the fully sampled direction (1 by default). The compression matrices are returned as an
# array of size $N_x \times N_c \times N_v$:

acqDataGCC, ccMatGCC = geometricCoilCompression(acqData, numVC)
size(ccMatGCC)

# !!! warning
#     `geometricCoilCompression` requires Cartesian data in which dimension `dim` is fully sampled; otherwise it
#     throws an `ArgumentError`. The other dimensions can be undersampled: the result keeps the sampling pattern of
#     the input.

# For the same number of virtual coils, geometric coil compression keeps slightly more of the signal:

imageGCC = rootSumOfSquares(reconstruction(acqDataGCC, params))
showimages([referenceImage, imageSCC, imageGCC],
           ["8 coils", "SCC, NRMSD $(deviation(imageSCC))", "GCC, NRMSD $(deviation(imageGCC))"])

# The difference between the methods depends on the number of virtual coils:

numVCs = 1:7
deviationsSCC = [nrmsd(referenceImage, rootSumOfSquares(reconstruction(
                    first(softwareCoilCompression(acqData, n)), params))) for n in numVCs]
deviationsGCC = [nrmsd(referenceImage, rootSumOfSquares(reconstruction(
                    first(geometricCoilCompression(acqData, n)), params))) for n in numVCs]

fig = Figure(size = (450, 320))
ax = Axis(fig[1, 1], xlabel = "Number of virtual coils", xticks = numVCs, ylabel = "NRMSD", yscale = log10)
scatterlines!(ax, numVCs, deviationsSCC, label = "SCC")
scatterlines!(ax, numVCs, deviationsGCC, label = "GCC")

# ## Compression and Coil Sensitivities
#
# A SENSE reconstruction, as in [Multi-Coil Reconstruction](@ref multicoil-reconstruction), needs one sensitivity map
# per coil. After compression, the data belong to virtual coils, so the sensitivities must be those of the virtual
# coils. We undersample the data as in that tutorial and reconstruct with all 8 coils for comparison:

acqDataSub = sample_kspace(acqData, 4.0, "poisson", calsize = 30)
sensitivities = espirit(acqDataSub, (6, 6), 30, eigThresh_2 = 0)

paramsSENSE = Dict{Symbol, Any}()
paramsSENSE[:reco] = "multiCoil"
paramsSENSE[:reconSize] = (320, 320)
paramsSENSE[:solver] = CGNR
paramsSENSE[:reg] = L2Regularization(1e-3)
paramsSENSE[:normalizeReg] = MeasurementBasedNormalization()
paramsSENSE[:iterations] = 10
paramsSENSE[:senseMaps] = sensitivities
imageSENSE = abs.(reconstruction(acqDataSub, paramsSENSE)[:, :, 1, 1, 1, 1])
nothing #hide

# We compress the undersampled data with [`softwareCoilCompression`](@ref). It only uses the measured samples, so it
# can be applied directly to undersampled data:

acqDataSubCC, ccMatSub = softwareCoilCompression(acqDataSub, numVC)
nothing #hide

# There are two ways to obtain the sensitivities of the virtual coils.
#
# **Estimate them from the compressed data.** This is the simplest option: the virtual coils are treated like
# physical ones.

sensitivitiesCC = espirit(acqDataSubCC, (6, 6), 30, eigThresh_2 = 0)
paramsSENSE[:senseMaps] = sensitivitiesCC
imageSENSE_CC = abs.(reconstruction(acqDataSubCC, paramsSENSE)[:, :, 1, 1, 1, 1])
nothing #hide

# **Compress existing sensitivities.** The data of coil $c$ are the Fourier transform of $S_c\,x$. A virtual coil
# combines the data with the weights $A_{cv}$, so its sensitivity is the same combination of the coil
# sensitivities:
# ```math
# S_v(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{c} S_c(\mathbf{r}) A_{cv}.
# ```
# [`applyCoilCompressionSensitivityMaps`](@ref) computes this product along the coil dimension. It accepts the
# vector of matrices returned by `softwareCoilCompression`, one per slice:

sensitivitiesCC2 = applyCoilCompressionSensitivityMaps(sensitivities, ccMatSub)
paramsSENSE[:senseMaps] = sensitivitiesCC2
imageSENSE_CC2 = abs.(reconstruction(acqDataSubCC, paramsSENSE)[:, :, 1, 1, 1, 1])

showimages([imageSENSE, imageSENSE_CC, imageSENSE_CC2],
           ["8 coils, NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE))",
            "$numVC VC, ESPIRiT after CC, NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE_CC))",
            "$numVC VC, compressed maps, NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE_CC2))"])

# With 4 instead of 8 coils, the reconstruction is barely worse, while each iteration only has to process half the
# data.
#
# The same works for geometric coil compression. The profiles are missing along the second dimension, so the first
# dimension (the readout) is fully sampled and can be used with `dim = 1`. The compression matrix now depends on
# the position $x$ along this dimension, and the sensitivities are compressed row by row:
# $S_v(x, y) = \sum_c S_c(x, y) A_{cv}(x)$. No Fourier transform is needed, because the sensitivities are already
# in image space:

acqDataSubGCC, ccMatSubGCC = geometricCoilCompression(acqDataSub, numVC, dim = 1)
paramsSENSE[:senseMaps] = applyCoilCompressionSensitivityMaps(sensitivities, ccMatSubGCC, dim = 1)
imageSENSE_GCC = abs.(reconstruction(acqDataSubGCC, paramsSENSE)[:, :, 1, 1, 1, 1])
showimages([imageSENSE, imageSENSE_CC2, imageSENSE_GCC],
           ["8 coils, NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE))",
            "$numVC VC (SCC), NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE_CC2))",
            "$numVC VC (GCC), NRMSD $(deviation(imageSENSE_GCC))"])

# The same matrices can be applied to other data with [`applyCoilCompression`](@ref), for example to another
# `AcquisitionData` measured with the same coils, or to the k-space returned by [`kDataCart`](@ref):

kspaceCC = applyCoilCompression(kDataCart(acqDataSub), ccMatSub)
size(kspaceCC)

# ## Summary
#
# - Look at the singular values to choose the number of virtual coils.
# - [`softwareCoilCompression`](@ref) works for any trajectory and for undersampled data.
# - [`geometricCoilCompression`](@ref) is restricted to Cartesian data with a fully sampled direction, usually the
#   readout, and keeps a bit more signal for the same number of virtual coils.
# - For SENSE reconstructions, either estimate the sensitivities from the compressed data, or compress the existing
#   sensitivities with the same matrix as the data ([`applyCoilCompressionSensitivityMaps`](@ref)).
